<p>Our analysis shows that this non-empty void method does not actually perform any useful work. Please check it: probably there's a mistake in its code or its body can be fully removed.</p>

<p>We are trying to reduce the false positives as much as possible, but in some cases this warning might be wrong. Common false-positive cases include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The method is intended to trigger loading of some class which may have a side effect.</li>
    <li>The method is intended to implicitly throw some obscure exception.</li>
</ul>
